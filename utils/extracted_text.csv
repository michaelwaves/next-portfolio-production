 Cover Letters Made Easy ,CoverMeGPT
" Cover letters are annoying. You have to write a new one for every job, and they all sound the same. Why not have AI do it for you? We built a custom website in React, and used the OpenAI API to generate cover letters based on your resume and the job description. We also used firebase to store user data and authentication, and you can save multiple profiles to group related experiences. ",CoverMeGPT

 Welcome to the future of medical forms ,Lumigui
" Filling in forms is no fun, but it's even worse when using pens and ipads touched by dozens of sick people. We wanted to create a touchless interface for filling in medical forms. So we built a custom website in react, wrote a python autogui script, and designed an arduino board with five photoresistors. Users could use five functions: next, previous, enter, delete, and activate voice typing. The photoresistors would detect the user's hand and trigger the autogui script to perform the corresponding action. We also designed and 3D printed a custom box to make it look cool. My friend and I stayed up until 6am building, testing, and filming our submission video ",Lumigui
